## Step 1 - Discuss Client Needs/Ideas
In this step the main focus is to gather a clients ideas and needs in their website
design and functionality. This is a massively important step as without it you will
be going in blind. Planning is important before hand to understand the concepts needed
in the design and development process.

## Step 2 - Contract / Time-map Discussion
This step will include discussing deadlines and payment amounts/dates. From here on out,
this will be done in a contractual way to secure customer and business protections. All work
time will be kept within the software titled __"Clockify"__ to ensure the customer is paying for
the amount of work I state I have done. Software is due to change if it isn't as in-depth
as needed or in certain circumstances.

## Step 3 - Wireframe / Prototype
Using Adobe XD and Photoshop skills I will begin to map out a working prototype and Wireframe
for the client to put their "ideas on paper." This will not only help the customer get a visual
representation of what the project will look like in later time, but will also allow me to
better understand the thought process behind each function of the site and come up with a well
rounded design strategy that meets the customer's needs in a professional way.

## Step 4 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Design)
Step 4 is where the design elements will begin. It is crucial to get some part of the site working
for customer viewing purposes and to get the basic designed template of the site down. This Step is 100% focused on design and not the programming/functionality yet. UX/UI is the focus and creating a site that customers will enjoy to visit and be intrigued to use. During this process I will consider multiple design ideas and pathways. These can range from display type, software used (CMS or Custom Code...Bootstrap?), and more. The main focus is to get the basic pages out of the way.

## Step 5 - Showcase and Discussion
From here I will showcase the design aspect I have finished to my customer. This is where any corrections will be made based on customer need/wants and where we may have to take time fixing certain aspects of the design part of the site. After this is finished we will discuss functionality and decide on the best route to take to ensure the site can do what we want it to in an optimized manner.

## Step 6 - Server-side code and Hard Functionality
This step is where we will bring in any contact with servers, databases, and any code that makes the website actually function. Combine all of these aspects within the HTML elements previously created to make the site come to life. Test functionality again using testing software (Yarn, Mocha, personal testing (no software)). This is the main area to test validations, payment software, login software and more.

## Step 7 - Showcase and Discussion 2
Once again we will meet with the client and discuss the functionality added and the testing conclusions. This will be a time to discuss possible different routes to take with certain ideas or to bring more functionality into the site than previously talked about.

## Step 8 - Debug and Test
This step is used for implementing previously discussed ideas and changing anything the client may want changed in functionality and design. This is an important step for not only testing the new functionality but also retesting old functionality to make sure everything is working as expected before launch. Once again using yarn, mocha, personal testing.

## Step 9 - Launch and Debug
This will be a production launch of the software/site. This step is a crucial time to watch error codes that would have been implemented in step 6. Be open for fixing issues customers may face and helping everything go as smooth as possible. May release bug fixes within coming days and weeks to ensure site works as advertised.

## Step 10 - Maintenance and Updates
This step is one used to keep site maintenance under check and make sure things continue to run smoothly. Company may be interested in tech support ideas and hiring devs dedicated to those issues in the future. May discuss possible feature updates and more future development with the client.
